But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, \"The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart.\" See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way...\n\nWhy God, why God do I gotta suffer?\nPain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle\nWhy God, why God do I gotta bleed?\nEvery stone thrown at you restin' at my feet\nWhy God, why God do I gotta suffer?\nEarth is no more, why don't you burn this muh'fucka?\n\nI beat yo ass, keep talkin' back\nI beat yo ass, who bought you that?\nYou stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken\nI beat yo ass if you jump on my couch\nI beat yo ass if you walk in this house\nWith tears in your eyes, runnin' from poopoo and 'prentice\nGo back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga\nThat homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass\nYo' teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class\nThat pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all\nThat TV better not be loud if you got it on\nThem Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em\nBetter not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter\nBetter not hear you got caught up\nI beat yo ass, you better not run to your father\nI beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin\nI got beaucoup payments to make\nCounty building's on my ass\nTryna take my food stamps away\nI beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here\nI beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here\nSeven years old, think you run this house by yourself?\nNigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else\n\nIf I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up\nAnd then I'd take two puffs\nI'm high now, I'm high now\nI'm high now, I'm high now\nLife's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now\n(I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth)\n\nI'll prolly die anonymous\nI'll prolly die with promises\nI'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house\nI'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out\nI'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'\nI'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches\nI'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me false accused\nI'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool\nOr maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra\nOr maybe die because these smokers\nAre more than desperate\nI'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges\nBody slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'\nOr maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax\nOr die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast\nI'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments\nI'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'\nI'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17\nAll worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things\n\nIf I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up\nAnd then I'd take two puffs\nI've been hungry all my life\nI'm high now, I'm high now\nI'm high now, I'm high now\nLife's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now\nNow...\n\nWhen I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear\nAccumulated 10 times over throughout the years\nMy newfound life made all of me magnified\nHow many accolades do I need to block denial?\nThe shock value of my success put bolts in me\nAll this money, is God playin' a joke on me?\nIs it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?\nTake it from me and leave me worse than I was before?\nAt 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all\nScared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall\nScared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'\n30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus\nWhat is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks\nJust to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?\nI read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered\nHow did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?\nThe type of shit'll make me flip out\nAnd just kill somethin', drill somethin'\nGet ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'\nI practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck\nAt 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged\nHow they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city\nWhat they say 'bout me reveal\nIf my reputation would miss me\nWhat they see from me\nWould trickle down generations in time\nWhat they hear from me\nWould make 'em highlight my simplest lines\n\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride\n'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me\nSo hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin' for resolutions until somebody get back\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me\nSo hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nWonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap\n\nDamn\nGoddamn you\nGoddamn me\nGoddamn us\nGoddamn we\nGoddamn us all\n\nVerse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like your children, your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you.
